To test your Flask API with example data using Postman, you can follow these steps:

Start your Flask API by running the app.py script. Make sure it's running on your local machine, typically at http://localhost:5000.

Open Postman, if you haven't already installed it, download and install it from the Postman website.

Create a new request in Postman:
Open Postman.
Click the "New" button to create a new request.
Enter a name for your request, e.g., "Ask Question."

Set the request type to "POST":
In the request tab, select "POST" from the dropdown menu.

Set the request URL to your API endpoint:
In the URL field, enter the URL of your API endpoint, which is typically http://localhost:5000/api/ask if you're running your Flask API locally.

Configure the request body:
Click on the "Body" tab in Postman.
Choose "form-data" as the body type.

Add the file and question fields:
Click the "Add Row" button to add two fields.
Set the first field to "file."
Select the file you want to upload as the value of the "file" field.
Set the second field to "question."
Enter a sample question as the value.

Click the "Send" button:
Click the "Send" button to send the request to your API.

Observe the API response:
Postman will display the API response in the "Response" section. You should see the answer provided by your Flask API.

Repeat the process with different sample data:
You can create multiple requests with different sample questions and PDF files to test various scenarios.

That's it! You've successfully tested your Flask API using Postman with example data. This process allows you to interact with your API and verify its functionality using different input data.
